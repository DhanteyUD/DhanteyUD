### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  



I am **<a href="https://clinton-otse.netlify.app" target="blank">Clinton Otse (Dante)</a>**, a **Software Developer** and **Graphic Designer** ...

I am a passionate full stack web developer, a freelance software engineer and graphic designer from Nigeria. My passion for software lies with brainstorming ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast. I learned a lot from open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happens through open-source.
